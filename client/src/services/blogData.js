        excerpt: "What you eat after your workout is just as important as the workout itself. Learn how to refuel effectively.",
        content: `
            <p>The 45-minute window after your workout is critical for recovery. This is when your muscles are most receptive to nutrients that repair tissue and replenish energy stores.</p>
            
            <h3>Protein is Key</h3>
            <p>Aim for 20-30g of high-quality protein. Whey protein, chicken breast, or Greek yogurt are excellent choices to trigger muscle protein synthesis.</p>
            
            <h3>Don't Fear Carbs</h3>
            <p>Carbohydrates replenish glycogen stores. Fast-digesting carbs like white rice, bananas, or sweet potatoes are ideal immediately post-workout.</p>
            
            <h3>Hydration Matters</h3>
            <p>You lose more than just water through sweat. Ensure you're replenishing electrolytes like sodium and potassium along with plenty of water.</p>
